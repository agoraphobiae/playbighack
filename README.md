===========

Watch youtube videos, listen to music, and construct playlists with friends in private rooms. Planning on making rooms save playlists so you can come back later and restart it, kind of like radio - turn it on and it's still there.

Flask + socket.io + YouTube API. [Live demo](http://playbighack.herokuapp.com) (not quite working right).
